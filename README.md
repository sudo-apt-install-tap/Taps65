# Taps65 ⌨️

A custom mechanical keyboard project designed to replace my current daily driver.  
Not a showpiece. Not a concept. Something I can actually use every day.

This project documents the full process of designing and building a keyboard from scratch, following **ai03’s keyboard design guide** as a reference.

## 📌 About the Project

Taps65 is a personal keyboard project focused on:
- Practical daily usability
- Clean and understandable design
- Learning proper keyboard PCB design workflows

I’m aiming for something reliable, simple, and functional—no unnecessary fluff.

If you’re following along and something doesn’t make sense, ai03’s guide is highly recommended. It explains the fundamentals far better than I can.
